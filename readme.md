# 🎨 Virtual Air Painting with Hand Gesture Recognition  

This project implements a **virtual air painting** system using **OpenCV, Mediapipe, and a Random Forest model** for hand gesture recognition. The system allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures, with the ability to change colors and erase strokes.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

### ✅ Hand Gesture Recognition:  
- Uses **Mediapipe** to track hand landmarks  

- Uses a **Random Forest** model to classify hand gestures:  

  - ✋ **Open Palm** → Stops writing  

  - ✍ **Writing Hand** → Allows drawing  

### ✅ Painting Features:  

- 🖍 **Draw** using your **index finger**  

- 🎨 **Change colors** dynamically  

- ❌ **Erase** or **clear** the canvas  

- 📺 **Real-time visual feedback** on the screen  

### ✅ Optimized for Performance:  

- 🏎 **Efficient deque-based** stroke storage  

- ⚙ **Fixed IndexError** for seamless drawing  

- 🔄 **Smooth animations & real-time processing**  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  

- **Python**  

- **OpenCV** (for real-time video processing)  

- **Mediapipe** (for hand tracking)  

- **Scikit-learn** (for Random Forest classification)

### 🔧 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Virtual-Air-Painting.git
cd Virtual-Air-Painting
```

2️⃣ Install Dependencies :
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ Run the Application


### 🖥️ Usage Instructions :
1️⃣ Start the program and position your hand in front of the camera.

2️⃣ Select a color by pointing your index finger to the color buttons at the top.

3️⃣ Draw in the air by moving your index finger while the model detects a "Writing Hand."

4️⃣ Stop drawing by opening your palm.

5️⃣ Clear the screen by selecting the "CLEAR" button.

🛑 Press 'q' to exit the program.

### 📊 Model Training:
- Improve Model Accuracy with more training data

- Support Multiple Gestures for additional features

- Enhance UI with better button design

- Save Drawings as image files
